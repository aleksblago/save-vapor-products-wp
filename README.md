# Save Vapor Products - Support H.R.2058
This is a small WordPress plugin that behaves similarly to the SOPA/PIPA plugins from a few years ago.

Basically, this plugin will blackout your website on November 5th, 2015 (Guy Fawkes day) between 8am and 8pm local time and instead, show your website's visitors a message about why it's important to support [H.R.2058] and how to go about doing so.

To briefly explain why this matters, supporting this bill would change the grandfather date for "deemed tobacco products". This makes it possible for all of the vapor products currently on the market, to stay on the market. Without this change, the vape industry as we know it will be decimated.
