# Save Vapor Products - Support H.R.2058
This is a WordPress plugin that acts sort of like the SOPA/PIPA protest plugins from years ago. It basically blacks out the website it is installed on and redirects the user to a page that explains why H.R.2058 is important to the vape community and how they can help support the cause.

This plugin will blackout your website on November 5th, 2015 (Guy Fawkes day) between 8am and 8pm local time to help teach vapers about supporting [H.R.2058]. Support for this would change the grandfather date for "deemed tobacco products" so that all of the vapor products currently on the market, can stay on the market.
